                We are gamers like you. We were looking for a simple portal for
                news about our favorite game and while there is many sites
                covering Warzone, none of them have a clear focus on this game.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Also, we found the sites too busy with ADs and other
                distractions - we simply wanted something better. And this is
                hopefully this portal, aggregating news about Warzone from
                various sources in a clean, responsive design.

                We will keep this site free and independent. We will not accept
                any help from anyone than you - Patreon link is below and we are
                considering other options. For now, the operation costs are
                minimal and we can cover them from our pockets.
